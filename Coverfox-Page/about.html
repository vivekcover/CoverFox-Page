					The idea of Coverfox came into being over a heated discussion we had over dinner sometime in 2012.</p>
					<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						Insurance buying was frustrating, confusing and swear word inducing! Managing a policy was even worse. People around us were intimidated with the mere mention of the word. They complained that there was no transparency with insurance buying. It baffled us to think that an important and practical investment like insurance had to be this way. 
					</p>
					<h3>THE BACKGROUND</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We're a bunch of guys that love technology and its ability to make things simple. <br><br>
						We have been associated with the insurance industry for more than a decade in some way or the other. We have done sales and marketing for insurance companies, build technology for them, run insurance company call centers, managed their lead generation programs amongst other things. <br><br>
						So on that fated night in 2012, we just couldn't get past the fact that the world had moved to 3D printing, scientists were exploring life on Mars, driverless cars were that much closer to reality. And here we were, still frustrated, and more worryingly, still intimidated by the whole process of buying and managing a simple insurance policy. <br><br>
						We decided we had no right to complain about the status quo if we couldn't offer a solution.
					</p>
					<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We created Coverfox to address this problem, with a lot of thought, effort and love. It is meant to be a user-friendly and an intuitive portal, whose sole reason of being is to make the process of buying and managing insurance easier, simple and transparent. <br><br> 
						Actually our goal is to make it easy enough for you to never again make put off the decision of buying insurance endlessly like most of us do! We, at Coverfox, want to bring about ease and transparency into the whole deal. So you don't ever wonder or be clueless about your insurance decisions. 
					</p>
					<h3>HOW WE DO IT</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We do it simply by bringing together 3 important forces:
					</p>
					<h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We have obsessed over each detail, every insight to build an extremely smart comparison engine, that helps you see and choose from the best insurance plan across top insurance companies: be it health, motor, travel or home. <br><br>
						(Currently our team is also working to extend our offerings across life insurance policies, which should be available on the website in the near future.)<br><br>
						Not only that, we have designed Coverfox to have a clean, easy to follow user interface, a pleasant user experience, and a transaction cycle that starts with you inputting your details, choosing a plan and buying it in less than 5 minutes. Once you buy, Coverfox enables you to manage your policy including renewing, getting claims support, getting your tax certificates, changing your address all at the click of a button. 
					</p>
					<h3>INSURANCE EXPERTISE</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We have gathered a team of insurance experts, each with over 10 years of industry and domain expertise, to carefully look at all the fine print, all the details and rate over 200+ plans.  <br><br>

						We have also partnered with over 20 top insurance companies in India to bring to you a wide, unbiased choice in plans at the most competitive prices. <br><br> 

						We have a brokers' license mandated from IRDA. This allows us to work on a standard commission basis with all companies independently. <br><br> 

						This is important because of 2 reasons, <br>
						</p><ul class="lead">
							<li>It helps us remain unbiased and offer/recommend you plans, that are most suitable to you. </li>
							<li>It allows us to be relentlessly transparent and work on behalf of, and on the side of our customers always. Even at times of claims disputes!</li>
						</ul>
					<p></p>
					<h3>CUSTOMER SUPPORT INSURANCE EXPERTISE</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						Our customers are our top priority. It is for you, and because of you, that we exist!  <br><br>
						So we have invested in the best customer support team, made up of diverse individuals, right from Computer Science Graduates, Commerce Professionals, Pharmaceutical Post Graduates to engineers, all bound by the common trait of loving people. <br><br>
						They work day in and day out to help our customers make their decision and manage their policies. We take pride in our team that goes out of their way to solve all your queries, problems and issues. <br><br>
						Why do we bother with all this? So we can enable our customers with the best choices in the insurance market, the best prices and the best experience overall.<br><br>
						We have built and nurtured Coverfox to be your one stop destination for all your insurance needs. We would love to hear from you, bouquets, brickbats as well as suggestions. It is after all our constant endeavor and ultimate aim: to help us help you, our customers!
