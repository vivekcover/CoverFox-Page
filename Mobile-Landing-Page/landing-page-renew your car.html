				<h3>Why do you need to renew your car insurance policy?</h3>
				<p>Car insurance is mandatory, so as long as you have a car, the annual drill of renewing your car insurance is pretty much set. Since it is a recurring annual cost that you need to bear, we’ll help you to get the best deal for you every time you renew your motor policy.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3>Do I lose any money or value of my existing policy on account of early renewal?</h3>
				<p>All companies start offering renewals 45 days before the expiry of your policy.
				Even as you renew before your due date, your new policy will only start after the previous one expires. This ensures you don’t lose any value of the premium paid earlier, or to put it simply, lose any money.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3>Why is it important to research & compare at the time of renewing motor insurance?</h3>
				<p>It is extremely important to research and compare car insurance quotes, especially when you have to renew your policy. <br /><br /> 

				Since the insurance companies analyse rates and claims on an ongoing basis, rate revisions are as often as 15 days for different car models. So there is a very high chance that you’d be able to get a better deal each consecutive year. This is more likely to be in your favor if you’ve had a claim free year. As you may be aware, you are entitled to an annual no claim bonus, in the form of discount on your premium.<br /><br />

				This discount will lapse if you don’t renew your policy within 90 days of your policy lapsing.<br /><br />

				It might also be a good idea to switch insurance companies in case your current company might be loading the premium, i.e. charging you a higher premium, based on your claim history. <br /><br />

				A simple thumb rule to help you decide if you’re getting the right deal, when you’ve made no claims in the previous year is to see if your premium quote is about 20-25% lower than the previous year.
