                   Car insurance is an extremely important investment you make to protect against financial losses 
					on account of damage to your car. In India, car insurance is primarily of 2 kinds: Third Party Liability and Comprehensive Coverage. <br /><br />
					As the name suggests, third party liability insurance insures you for the legal liability you may have on account of your car causing third party damages to third parties. This could be damage to property or injury to person. This is mandatory as per Indian laws.<br /><br />
					Comprehensive coverage helps  you get protection for financial loss on account of damage, theft or total loss of your own car. This protection can be further enhanced to protect against specific kind of losses, by way of add ons, such as Engine Protect, Zero Depreciation etc. Know more about them through this infographic (* TO INSERT LINK TO ADD ON INFOGRAPHIC BLOG LINK)
